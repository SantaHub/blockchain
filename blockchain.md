# Blockchain

### Vocabulary :

- Bitcoin : The concept of Bitcoin or the entire network.
- bitcoin : a unit of currency of bitcoin, BTC or XBT
- bit : 1,000k bit == 1 BTC
- Block Chain : public record of Bitcoin transactions
- Block : record in block chain that contains and confirms many waiting transactions
- confirmation : transcation irreversible added to the block.
- cryptography : encrypts blockchain and adds security
- double spend : malicious user spending to two recipients at same time.
- Hash rate : measuring unit of processing power of Bitcoin, the network.
- Mining : Processing confirmations
- private key : allows to spend from a specific wallet
- Signature : provides ownership with private key sign
- Wallet : contains private key and record of BTC owned

Learning Outcomes :
    - Explain 3 fundamental characteristics that define blockchain
    - Important features of Ethereum blockchain
    - Algo and techniques that enable a blockchain : crypto and hashing
    - outline methods for realizing trust in a blockchain

## Week 1 : Blockchained Defined

### Blockchain

- ConsenSys : John Wolpert
    - Largest blockchain company
    - based on Wash DC
    - New Venture development lab
    - blockchain : nimble procerious route for transaction

### Bitcoin and Blockchain
    - Blockchain :
        - p2p transaction of digital asset without intermediatry
        - user cases : Goods transfer, Media transfer, Platform for decentralised business logic, distributed resources, crowd operation and fundings
        - democratic approach
    - Bitcoin :
        - continuous working digital currency
        - Autonomous decentralized application
        - Satoshi Nakamoto : creator of TBC
    - Blockchain :
        - Software program for Validation, Verification and consensus
        - P2P transcation in decentralized network
        - Establisihing trust among peers
        - Recording transactions in distributed ledger
    Establishing trust :
        - Have a process in place to validate, verify and confirm transcations and can be done by :
            - Record transaction in a ledger
            - record the transaction in distributed ledger of blocks
            - create a tamper-proof record of chains of blocsl.
            - implement a conensus protocol to add to the chain 
        - Provides us with : Validation, verification, consensus and immutable recording.

### Blockchain Structure :
- transaction - block - chain
- consensus process used to add block. Verified my miners.
- UTXO : Unspend transaction output
- Set of all UTXO defines the state of the Bitcoin blockchain
- UTXO Structure : 
    - Unique ID of the transaction created by UTXO
    - its index in output list
    - value/amount its good for
    - optional contract
- transaction
